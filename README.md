## this is a series of single-header libraries designed to make writing graphics programs in software-rendered SDL with C or C++ much nicer
### it abstracts features from SDL2 and also the main function, giving you an init, setup, update and draw function, inspired by p5.js
### you may use it but do not remove credit
